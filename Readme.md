# Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps for Visualizations and Tag based Search on the MovieLens Dataset

<img src="Maps.png" alt="Component Planes showing the distribution of SciFi, Cyborgs and Black and White movies" />

This Package contains the code used to generate visualizations of Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps
used on the MovieLens Dataset and find movies and similar tags for queries of preferred and non-preferred tags made by users.

# Usage

This project requires Swift 4

## Installation

- Build with `swift build --configuration release`.

## Running

### Learn the dataset

A movie vector file needs to be generated from `genome-scores.csv`.

```
./.build/release/SOMTrainer convert <genome-scores-filepath> <output-path>
```

The training subcommand expects 2 files:

1. The `genome-tags.csv` file from the MovieLens dataset
2. The movie vector file generated in the previous step

```
./.build/release/SOMTrainer train <map-width> <map-height> <iterations> <genome-tags-filepath> <movie-vectors-filepath> <som-output-filepath>
```

After training is finished, the SOM is written to the specified output location.

### Render the trained SOM

The visualization subcommand expects 3 files:

1. The SOM file generated in the training phase.
2. The `genome-tags.csv` file from the MovieLens dataset.
2. The file generated by joining movie names with `genome-scores.csv`.


```
./.build/release/SOMRenderer <som-filepath> <genome-tags-filepath> <joined-movies-scores-filepath> <pdf-output-filepath>
```

This will render the U-Matrix showing the average distance between neighbouring tiles, each component plane and the distribution of data points into a PDF file.

### Searching for tags and movies

A HTTP server responds to GET requests on /movies/:query and /tags/:query, where :query will be replaced by a JSON request string.

```
./.build/release/SOMServer <som-filepath> <genome-tags-filepath> <movies-filepath> <joined-movies-scores-filepath> <links-csv-filepath>
```

### Generating visualizations of the training process of a Self-Organizing Map

```
./.build/release/SOMTrainingVisualizer <step> <iterations> <output-filepath>
```

Renders every `step`-iteration of the training phase of a Self-Organizing Map on a two-dimensional uniformly distributed data set into a PDF file.
